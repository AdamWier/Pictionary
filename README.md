## Dev

## Require
To play O'draw, you only need a device (computer, smartphone....), an internet connection, that's all.
You only need to log in (or register) and join/create a game and....
Go!!!
## Getting started
If it's you'r first time on O'draw, you first have to create an account by register by providing only an Email and a userName.
If you are already register, you only have to login.
### create a game
In O'draw, you have many way to play a game.
The easier way to do it is to create a game and then, invite your friends in. When the team is full, game start automaticaly.
### Search/ join a game
If you don't want to create a game, you have 2 option:
+ you can use the "search' tool to find all game that you can join by clicking on it.
+ you can wait for an invitation. If some one send you an invitation, a little window will pop and you will be able to join the game or decline the invitation.
### Play a game
Now that you have create/join a game, it's time to draw!
A player begin as a drawer and other player begins as guesser. At the end of each turn, the drawer become a guesser an next player become the drawer.
Each player will draw a least 3 time.
* when you play as a drawer
The drawer will get a random word, select by O'draw. He will be the only one to see that word and he willl have to make other player guess it by drawing in a canvas in a limit time.
The drawer will see all answers provides by other player but won't be able to chat with them.
Drawer have a limit time to make the other players guess what he is drawing on canvas.
If time is off, turn end and another player is pick as drawer.
* when you play as guesser
While drawer is drawing (thx Mr Obvious) other player will access live stream draw and will try to guess by typping answer.
When a guesser type an answer, only the drawer will be able to see it.
If guesser provide the good answer, he get some points
+ if he is the first to provide the good answer, increase points by 3. (He wont be able to provide other answer until the end of this turn)
+ if he provide the good answer but not first, increase point by one. (He wont be able to provide other answer until the end of this turn)
+ if guesser does not provide a good answer, score does not change
Party will end when all players had drawn 3 times.
At the end of the game, the player with the biggest amount of points win the party and all players will be back on homePage to restart a new game and have fun again !!
